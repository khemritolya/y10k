# Want to change the values that y10k uses to generate the galaxy?
#
# Well, here they are. Go nuts, but at your own risk
#
# See Galaxy.java for how they are used
# see GalaxyConstManager.java for the manager
#
# Format:
#
# [Const Name] [Number Value]
#

# Use a seed for generating new galaxies
# 0 = no
# 1 = yes
use_seed 0

# The seed RNGesus uses to generate the galaxy
# if specified
seed 1776

# How many radians should the galaxy be long?
spiral_length 15

# How wide should a spiral radius be?
spiral_radius 180

# spiral peter
# the larger this value, the harder the spiral will peter out
spiral_peter 5

# How fast should the spiral grow?
# General equation for the spiral is r = a * theta ^ b
# where a = expansion_factor and b = expansion exponent
expansion_exponent 2.4
expansion_factor 10

# How dense should the spiral be?
spiral_adj_density 900

# How dense should the core be?
core_adj_density 1000

# How large should the non-spiral disk of stars be?
galaxy_radius 13000

# How dense should the average non-spiral stars be?
regular_adj_density 12200

# Squish constants, I have them at 1, but you may want to mess around w/ them
x_squish 0.7
y_squish 0.8
